    "description": "On parle beaucoup de réflexion en Java/Kotlin et je vous l’accorde c’est assez marrant à coder. Mais son utilisation n’est pas gratuite, augmentation de la mémoire, ralentissement de l’application et magie vaudou sont 3 bonnes raisons pour envisager de s’en passer.\r\n\r\nEn utilisant les annotations processors (apt ou kapt) nous pouvons faire générer du code à la compilation. Cela aura pour effet de rendre visible la magie, et donc de la démystifier tout en rattrapant les lenteurs causées par la réflexion.\r\n\r\nDans la génération de code, le plus compliqué c'est de se lancer.

At this point I will look at the way init reads various script files and starts all the native services (also known as daemons).\r\n\r\nInit starts the prototype Java runtime, known as the Zygote. The first instance of the Zygote runs the System Server, which is a container for the most important services that make up the Android framework. One of those services is the Activity Manager. This is the component which starts Android applications, beginning with those that have the persistent property, then the Home App, and finally sending  the BOOT_COMPLETED intent to kick off all other apps that want to start at boot.\r\n\r\nI will illustrate all of the above with code samples and walk-throughs to illustrate how you can make changes to customize each step.",

    "description": "When you look around among your developer friends and colleagues you’ll probably find that most of them use a computer running Windows or macOS. Sometimes that’s personal choice, in other cases employers or clients dictate which platform one would have to use. Every year around Christmas time there are articles with titles similar to “Why 20xx will be the year of the Linux desktop”, but has it ever really been *that* year?\r\n\r\nIn 2018, I made the jump from using macOS as my main platform to Linux and since then, people don’t stop to ask me how it went, what I did, what problems I ran into and why *they* could probably never make such a platform transition. The truth is: they - and you - probably could do it just fine as well.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll talk about and explain the pros and cons of my move to Linux. Starting from hardware and distributions choices to very Android-specific development challenges. Along the way I’ll explain the audience some of the underlying Linux concepts and show tools to match what they might be used to from Mac or Windows. After this talk, people will hopefully be more confident when it comes to leaving the mainstream operating systems macOS and Windows.",

In this class you implement generic behavior for all your activities.  \r\nThen one day, after creating your tenth activities with the same toolbar, you created ActivityToolBar that inherits from MotherActivity and factorizes the toolbar code in a single class.  \r\nAwesome: Factorization by inheritance.  \r\nAnd you keep going this way. Then you created LocationActivity that inherits ToolBarActivity and is able to provide the device location without more code to daughter activities.   \r\nNowadays, you have a graph of mothers classes in your project and it’s a real nightmare; you have ten different types of those classes with code replication because Java doesn’t allow multiple inheritances.  \r\nPerhaps your story is more about fragments.

We want to access everything from the point of our fingers and we want that as fast as possible. When an application is taking to long to open or process some data I bet you also feel the urge to search for another solution - or just to throw your smartphone against the nearest wall in despair. And while you think about this, you’re looking at that never ending spinner… that... it just doesn't seem to go away.\r\n\r\n* Google Play and the App Store are full of similar solutions... Why should I bother to keep using this one?\r\nWe can make all sort of optimisations on our code - and yet, sometimes, we can't really make that process as fast as we wanted. There are always some constraints that we can't really avoid - device limitations, network, server, etc. but we can create the illusion of speed - a visual aid that keeps the user busy while, on the background, we are processing his action.\r\n\r\nYes. Time is relative and we want the users to feel that every action is as responsible as possible.",

    "description": "Until now, in order to perform background work in Android, developers had to choose between multiple execution options. At Google I/O 2018, the Android team launched WorkManager as part of the Android Jetpack. This library provides a simple and clean interface to specify deferrable, asynchronous tasks and when they should run.\r\nThe presentation will include an overview about the existing background solutions, what’s happening behind the scenes and why and when we should use WorkManager. Also, we will discover details about the architecture of the WorkManager library and about the main components(Worker, WorkRequest, WorkManager, WorkInfo) of it. Finally, we will highlight how to use WorkManager for scenarios like chained sequences of tasks that run in a specified order, unique named sequences, tasks that pass and return values and how to apply constraints in order to decide when to run the task.",

    "description": "The introduction of Android Architecture Components made things are easier for the less experienced developers. However, In order to build robust, testable and scalable applications we need more. That's where the Unidirectional Data Flow architecture comes in, borrowed from Flex and Redux on the web. \r\n\r\nThe approach is based on the idea of an immutable state that represents the state of our app. All the components are decoupled from each other, and they work together taking advantage of Kotlin's language features. We solve the asynchrony problem using Coroutines, specifically Channels and Actors. \r\n\r\nDo you want to know more? This talk will guide you through our implementation of this paradigm, with clear steps and a detailed explanation that will help you understand its value and spark your curiosity!",

    "description": "With increasing capabilities and usabilities of Android apps  , the app size is also getting increased exponentially. Newer apps are coming in range of 60-180 MBs\r\n\r\nWhile not all the functionalities of app are being used instantly , or by all of the users. What If we get on-demand features , like on-demand movies, on-demand cars(grab). Having this flexibility will allow users to download their favourite app without worrying about size of the app. And thus as an organizatio/owner of the app , we can enable more and more users using our app , and features targetted to them.\r\n\r\nApp Bundle (available in Android Studio 3.2) provides this flexibility and allows us to minimize the download size of our app as required.Rest of the features will be downloaded when requested.\r\n\r\nOther best practices like modularization will further help us in benifitting from App Bundle.\r\n\r\nThis talk will include  whats and whys about App bundle , How to enable bundling in your app , and how to make that app size smaller.\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/\r\n",

In this talk, we’ll cover Could Firestore, Firebase's new database solution. It’s an efficient, low-latency database solution for mobile apps that is optimized for speed, security, and offline use. Cloud Firestore lets you build rich, high quality applications by allowing secure access to the database directly from client-side code. Besides being easy to use, it allows you to use queries to decrease the data usage and increase the security so that you can get just the info you need for your user. When offline, apps remain responsive because the Firebase SDK persists your data to disk, giving the end user an immersive experience. Come and learn how you can use Cloud Firestore to effortlessly build powerful realtime experiences on Android in a faster and more efficient way to bring your products to millions of users without worrying about scaling.",
